# Ramdom Color Generator

## Project description

Let's create a tool that generates multiple random colors and codes with JavaScript. Upon refreshing the page, the colors and codes change randomly for up to 30 color containers. The website is also designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes. It displays the colors in four columns on larger screens, then decreases to three, two, and ultimately one column for smaller screens. This provides a seamless user experience on any device.
